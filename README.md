# 7th-Python-Game
This is my first multiple question quiz/trivia game I made the morning of 10/30/21 from about 7:30am to 8:40am.
This game was a huge step forward in putting my knowledge of Python in practice. I think the thing that took me the longest was finding questions to ask.
I also love using time.sleep() to delay my code so what the user see's is very clean.
I am very used to using the random.randint function for all my random needs but that was a problem this time because it would replay the same question over. So I used random.choice and random.remove which I wasn't very confident would work correctly but it worked the first try! You love to see it.
